# tinc-sample

This is a set of sample configuration files, etc. for tincd.

## Use this ifâ€¦

* You have (a) roadwarrior(s) connecting to a gateway.
* You want the roadwarrior to be bridged to the LAN because you need broadcast / multicast packets to be forwarded.


## Why?

I have a fleet of Linux boxen at home, and one Windows PC for gaming.
This WinPC has Steam.
Steam has in-home streaming.
I am not at home. 
I want to be able to game from anywhere on the island, while offloading rendering to my desktop.
With this and SSH, I can carry around a weenie laptop instead of a monster.

## How?

Refer to the server directory for configuring the tinc server.

Refer to the client directory for Linux clients. (WIP)

Refer to the client-osx directory for OS X clients.

If you can get this working on Windows, I'll gladly accept contributions to a client-win directory.
